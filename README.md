# aratus-projects

A spike for a service that returns project definitions for a system that I still don't know very well what's going to do

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

You can also run the server with:

    lein run

And the project is ready to be imported into OpenShift online with a Clojure cartridge.
